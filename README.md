# Hydrus-transcode
## Description
Hydrus-transcode is an automation script written in python. It's build to simplify usage of my [hydrus-react](https://github.com/zaykok/hydrus-react) transcode feature.

## Requirements
Script is written with Linux in mind, though it might work on other systems.
You will need ffmpeg and magick package.

## Usage
This script is supposed to be an advanced feature and understanding of what transcoding is, how it works, how hydrus-client handles file repositories and tags is REQUIRED, without it you will probably just break your install.
<br />**BACKUP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE PLAYING AROUND WITH THIS**<br />
Inside the script you have to supplement path to your hydrus data folder and API key.

More help with usage available with -h parameter running the script.
